description: King Arthur, who held sway in Camelot with his Knights of the Round Table,
  was supposedly a king of Britain hundreds of years ago. Most of the stories about
  him are probably not historically true, but there was perhaps a real king named
  Arthur, or with a name very much like Arthur, who ruled somewhere in the island
  of Britain about the sixth century.
